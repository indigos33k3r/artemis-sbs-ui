10 billion periods = 1 "metric second"
	this is only about 1/10 of second more than current seconds. a good solid count

factor=10,000,000,000 / 9 192 631 770 

100 seconds in a "hectosecond" a.k.a. metric minute
(conventionalseconds count * factor) % 100 = 0

metricSecondFactor = (10000000000 / 9192631770);
((metricSecondFactor * missionMark) % 100 == 0)
