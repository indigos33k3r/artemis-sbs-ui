Terminate transmission in commsvideo is not quite right. set innerhtml of iframe?

imgs
	4 direcitonal arrows in two sizes and three colors
	button type 2
	button type 1 (toggle) middle section, refactor to use no borders
		selected class (lit hex)
	--cleanroom editions of everything
	orthogonal ship outline/diagrams

	LCARS skin

js
	--fullscreen toggle html5
	automagic startup routine
		process templates, defaultinator
		start fun animations on interval timers
		auto fullscreen
	COnsider jquery-ification or Angular-ification
	menu.html should use client-side QR-code generation to generate a hyperlink to itself

audio
	From Scratch:
		confirm
		notify
		alert
		processing


html
	settle out what meta tags are needed. don't forget "mobile-friendliness"
		open graph?


bargraph w/gradient
vertical bracket type thing with thresholds and currnt level
sine wave plotting in svg
div packaging for svg grid

animations
	special class "randomly_varying", with special companion javascript function that makes small numerical drift in the numbers in child cells/spans/p/li, occasionally changing the color, then stick it in a timer

	x,y scans of cartesian plane. Maybe some fake "pings"/locality highlights

	crossed ellipses that grow and shrink on axes

	waveform analyzer, graphing trig functions

	large text body scroller, with random pauses and highlights
	
	orrerry generator w/ varying orbit speeds

simple sample basic editions that are static, but greebly/glittery/fauxdynamic
fullscreen togglebutton on page
microtemplating
	datafeed
actual consumption from nodejs server's stats

woaH crazy details, share these:

	https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula#JavaScript
	auto-generate orrerry on RHS

Chronometer
	mission time mark's visual clock circle animation should also pause on HALT button
	time remaining needs a visual clcok circle, but counting down from 100% to 0%
	once clock goes red, reset should fix it, so should more time getting added.

Comms 
	mainscreen video. might need some hardware like switchers and volume controls

Ops
	crew task assignment/allocation:  cartesian plane, 4 primary tasks, bounded rect areas are crew allocations. http://fiddle.jshell.net/2h3tf4vq/4/
